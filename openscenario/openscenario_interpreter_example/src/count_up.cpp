  /* ---- NOTE -----------------------------------------------------------------
   *
   *  The scenario simulator can be started by the following command
   *
   *      ros2 launch scenario_test_runner scenario_test_runner.launch.py \
   *        scenario:=</path/to/scenario.yaml> \
   *        initialize_duration:=<unsigned integer (default: 30 [sec])>
   *
   *  The launched scenario simulator will setup the simulation with the
   *  following sequence.
   *
   *  (1) Load the given <scenario.yaml>.
   *
   *    (1a) At this time, if the scenario defines an entity of Vehicle type
   *         with `isEgo: true` specified, Autoware is launched
   *         (planning_simulator.launch.xml by default).
   *
   *    (1b) At this time, if `UserDefinedValueCondition` is defined in the
   *         scenario, it starts to subscribe to the topic name specified in
   *         `UserDefinedValueCondition.name`. The scenario simulator does not
   *         care about the activation of the node (the file you are looking at
   *         right now) that publishes the message corresponding to the topic
   *         name.
   *
   *  (2) Send initial coordinates, destination coordinates, etc. to Autoware
   *      sequentially according to the scenario definition.
   *
   *    (2a) At this time, the simulation time starts from minus
   *         `initialize_duration` seconds (t = -30 [sec] by default).
   *
   *    (2b) Here, the scenario simulator is hard-coded with the correct state
   *         transitions for Autoware. The simulation time starts from -30 sec
   *         is the grace time for the initialization of Autoware. If Autoware
   *         has not reached the WaitingForRoute state at simulation time zero,
   *         the scenario is terminated immediately as a failure.
   *
   *  (3) Send an engagement to `Autoware` to start the simulation.
   *
   *  The important thing to note in the above sequence is that "this node
   *  starts working well before the simulation starts". This behavior is
   *  especially problematic when you do your own time management within this
   *  node (using std::chrono, etc.). For example, if this node is supposed to
   *  take some specific action at 100 seconds after startup, it will actually
   *  take place roughly at simulation time 100 - initialize_duration seconds.
   *  Therefore, this node should not use absolute time as a trigger for its
   *  actions. A possible workaround is for this node to subscribe to its own
   *  `AutowareState` and manage its time starting from the point when the
   *  `AutowareState` transitions to Driving.
   *
   *  In short, this node should be purely dedicated to eavesdropping on
   *  Autoware topics and sending higher-order information computed from them
   *  to the simulator.
   *
