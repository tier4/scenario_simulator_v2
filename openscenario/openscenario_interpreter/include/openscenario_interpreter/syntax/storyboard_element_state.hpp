     *  The concept of accomplishing a goal varies depending on the type of

     *
     *  Action
     *    An Action's goal is a function of the Action type and cannot be
     *    generalized. Accomplishing an Action's goal will involve meeting some
     *    arbitrary prerequisites related with the Action type (for example, a
     *    SpeedAction accomplishes its goal when the considered Entity is
     *    travelling at the prescribed speed). If an Action is acting on an
     *    EntitySelection, all instances of Entity within the selection have to
     *    complete in order to reach the completeState of the Action.
     *
     *  Event
     *    An Event's goal is accomplished when all its Actions are in the
     *    completeState.
     *
     *  Maneuver
     *    A Maneuver's goal is accomplished when all its Events are in the
     *    completeState.
     *
     *  ManeuverGroup
     *    A ManeuverGroup's goal is accomplished when all its Maneuvers are in
     *    the completeState.
     *
     *  Act
     *    An Act's goal is accomplished when all its ManeuverGroups are in the
     *    completeState.
     *
     *  Story
     *    A Story's goal is accomplished when all its Acts are in the
     *    completeState.

     *  The completeState signals that the runtime instantiation of the

     *  interference. If the affected runtime instantiation of the
     *  StoryboardElement is defined with a maximumExecutionCount, to be
     *  complete implies that there are no more executions left to run, or a
     *  stopTransition has occurred.
     *
     *  Checking for completeness involves verifying if the given runtime
     *  instantiation of the StoryboardElement still has executions left upon
     *  finishing the runningState. This check returns false if there are
     *  executions left. This check returns true if there are no executions
     *  left, or if the maximumExecutionCount is not defined in the
     *  StoryboardElement.
     *
     *  Resetting the completeState can only be achieved externally by the
     *  parent StoryboardElement whose child is in the completeState. This may
     *  only occur if the parent initiates a new execution.
