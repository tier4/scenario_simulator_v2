# Vehicle Dynamics

In this section, we describe the vehicle model which is implemented in scenario_simulator_v2.


## Vehicle Model Types

Pose is calculated by bicycle kinematics model.

Steering and velocity models are implemented 3 types of models.

### IDEAL_STEER

Uses velocity command. The steering and velocity vary ideally as commanded.

### IDEAL_ACCEL

Uses acceleration command. The steering and acceleration varies ideally as commanded.

### DELAY_STEER

Uses velocity command. The steering and velocity vary following a first-order delay model.

### DELAY_STEER_ACC

Uses acceleration command. The steering and acceleration vary following a first-order delay model.

_Note_: The steering/velocity/acceleration dynamics is modeled by a first-order system with a deadtime in a _delay_ model. The definition of the _time constant_ is the time it takes for the step response to rise up to 63% of its final value. The _deadtime_ is a delay in the response to a control input.
