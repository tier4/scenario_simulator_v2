# Features

- Full and partial randomization of the Ego goal position for multiple test cases.

- NPCs customization:
  - number of NPCs
  - distance from the Ego
  - velocities of NPC vehicles in the simulation.

- Simulation related errors reporting:
  - Ego being found stuck in one place for too long.
  - Ego failing to reach the goal in a specified time.
  - Collision between Ego and NPC.

- Ego vehicle capabilities:
  - Goal following
  - Lane changing
  - Stopping precisely on a designated line
  - Yield at intersections

- NPCs possible actions:
  - Following the line.
  - Following another entity.

# Limitations

- Random test runner does not support traffic lights signalization.

- NPCs actions:
  - NPCs are not stopping to avoid collision when they are not following the colliding entity (eg. on the intersections).
  - NPCs are not able to yield at the intersection.


# Troubleshooting

There are two known issues which block random test runner from initializing the test if either initial position or goal pose exceeds the drivable area.

- If the initial position exceeds the drivable are: 

Autoware will be launched, but the ego vehicle will not move, waiting for Autoware to change its state to WaitingForEngage. After a timeout the test will terminate and the runner will continue with the next test.

After the test suite is completed, the `AutowareError` connected with the failed test will be logged to the `result.junit.xml` with the message: `Simulator waited for the Autoware state to transition to WaitingForEngage, but time is up. The current Autoware state is EMERGENCY.`

- If the generated goal pose exceeds the drivable ares: 

The test will be immediately stopped after launching the Autoware and similarly as in the first case the error will be logged and the runner will continue with the next test.

After the test suite is completed, the `scenario_simulator_error` connected with the failed test will be logged to the `result.junit.xml` with the message: `Requested the service "/api/routing/set_route_points" 1 times, but was not successful.`

# Launch arguments

This section describes arguments of the random test runner. All of them can be specified via command line, otherwise default value specified in the launch file is used. 

Parameters listed in [Node parameters](#node-parameters) section can be also specified in a yaml file which should be located in `<random_test_runner_directory>/param/`.

Parameters have the following source precedence priorities:
1. `*.yaml` file (applicable only for [Node parameters](#node-parameters))
2. Command line
3. Default values

## General arguments

| Parameter name               | Default value                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| `simulator_type`             |  `"simple_sensor_simulator"`  | Backend simulator. Currently supported value is `simple_sensor_simulator`. It's also accepted by the node but should be supplied as direct launch argument.                                                              |

## Autoware related arguments

Launch also accepts Autoware parameters that control Autoware related behavior. It can set which Autoware architecture is in use, which vehicle
and sensor model is used in the simulation

| Parameter name      | Default value                 | Description                                                               |

## Node parameters

Random testing supports several parameters to control test execution. They can be supplied either directly from command 
line or via `*.yaml` file inside `<random_test_runner_directory>/param/`. Example of the yaml file specifying parameters can be found [here](#example-parameters-yaml-file).

### Parameters reference

Random test runner parameters are split into three categories:

1. [Test control parameters](#test-control-parameters)

#### Map package

Package containing map information. This package needs to be built in the Autoware workspace. Package example can be found [here](https://github.com/tier4/AWSIM/releases/download/v1.2.0/shinjuku_map.zip).

The structure of the package needs to be as follows:

- The root package directory, which contains:
  - `package.xml` file
  - `CMakeList.txt` file
  - map directory, which contains:
    - `.osm` file
    - `.pcd` file

#### Lanelets positioning

Lanelet position used to represent the ego goal includes two coordinate:
  - the ID of the lanelet on which the target is located,
  - the translation along the lanelet.

On the example below two connected lanelets with IDs 101 and 100 are presented. The translation s is the distance between lanelet's beginning and the vehicle's rear axle position.

### Test case parameters

Test case parameters. Currently, only randomization seed.

| Parameter name  | Default value | Description                                                       |
|-----------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `seed`          |   `-1`        | Randomization seed. If `-1`, seed will be generated for each test |

### Example parameters yaml file
```
/**:
  ros__parameters:
    # control parameters
    "output_dir": "/tmp"
    "input_dir": ""

    # test suite parameters
    "test_name": "random_test"
    "map_name": "kashiwanoha_map"
    "ego_goal_lanelet_id": 34600 # -1 means full goal randomization
    "ego_goal_s": 5.0
```

# Results

After the test suite execution two files can be found in the specified output folder.

## Result yaml file

Stores parameters used to generate the test suite. This file might be used to rerun the tests as described in [Replay](QuickStart.md#how-to-replay).

### Example `result.yaml`:
```yaml
random_test:
  name: video_test
  map_name: kashiwanoha_map
  ego_goal_s: 5.000000000000000000
  ego_goal_lanelet_id: -1
  ego_goal_partial_randomization: false
  ego_goal_partial_randomization_distance: 30
  npc_count: 10
  npc_min_speed: 0.500000000000000000
  npc_max_speed: 3.000000000000000000
  npc_min_spawn_distance_from_ego: 10.000000000000000000
  npc_max_spawn_distance_from_ego: 50.000000000000000000
  test_cases:
    - seed: 1281242544
    - seed: 3644198185
    - seed: 2673087374
    - seed: 1312244741
    - seed: 2518911638
```

## Result JUnit file

The file contains information about errors which occurred during test cases which were executed by the random test runner.

If the execution of the test finished with an error the stored information contains type of the error and the message describing the error.

There are 3 types of error reported, related directly to the simulation, which are:
1. `Stand still error` - reported when ego is found stuck in one place for too long.
2. `Timeout error` - reported when ego fails to reach the goal in a specified time.
3. `Collision error` - reported when collision between ego and npc appears,
4. Exceptions caught during the runtime which includes:
    - `AutowareError`, 
    - `scenario_simulator_exception`,
    - `std::runtime_error`.


If any other error occurs during the random test runner execution, it will be stored along with the information that the `Unknown Error` has occurred.

### Example `result.junit.xml`:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<testsuites failures="0" errors="6" tests="5">
  <testsuite name="random_test" failures="0" errors="6" tests="5">
    <testcase name="4">
      <error type="stand still" message="Ego seems to be stuck" />
    </testcase>
    <testcase name="2">
      <error type="collision" message="npc2 and ego collided at 6.249999999999986s" />
      <error type="stand still" message="Ego seems to be stuck" />
    </testcase>
    <testcase name="3">
      <error type="collision" message="npc1 and ego collided at 17.25000000000011s" />
      <error type="timeout" message="Ego failed to reach goal within timeout" />
    </testcase>
    <testcase name="1">
