Scenario simulator v2 is a scenario testing framework for Autoware.

![Scenario Testing Framework](image/what_is_scenario_testing_framework.png "what is scenario testing framework")

It enables Autoware developers to write a scenario at once and run in various kinds of simulator.

## What can we do with this framework

Currently, various kinds of simulators and scenario formats are developed all over the world.
We need an open-source framework for integrating those testing tools with Autoware easily and quickly.
So, we are developing this package.
<font color="#065479E">**This package is designed to easily accommodate multiple simulators and scenario description formats.**</font>

## Why this framework is v2?

This package re-designs the [scenario runner](https://github.com/tier4/scenario_runner.iv.universe) developed by [TIER IV, Inc.](https://tier4.jp/en/), so we named this framework as "scenario_simulator_v2"
