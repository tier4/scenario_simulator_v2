     This provides an analytical method for calculating the acceleration that
     will allow the best possible accuracy in arriving at the waypoint during
     the last few frames. It provides the calculation of acceleration for
     arriving at waypoint without and with braking.

     The method allows to calculate only the last 3 steps without braking and 4
     with braking, because analytical calculation of a greater number of steps
     is difficult - a greater number of steps is processed through the
     prediction of the controller.

     Details:

     - Acceleration at the last step equal to 0.0, therefore in the penultimate
       step the acceleration is set to 0.0

     - Only with braking: speed at the last and penultimate step equal to 0.0,
       therefore when there are 3 steps remain the acceleration is calculated
       in such a way as to set the speed to 0.0 (a=-v/t)

     - Only with braking: because the speed is set to 0.0 when there are 3
       steps remain, in the last 3 steps no distance will be traveled,
       therefore, when there are 4 steps remain, it is necessary to choose the
       acceleration in such a way as to travel exactly the remaining distance
       in this step (s = at^2/2+vt -> a = 2(s-vt)/t^2).

     - Only without braking: in the penultimate step, the acceleration is set
       to 0, therefore, when 3 steps remain it is necessary to choose the
       acceleration in such a way as to ensure that in the penultimate and last
       step the distance traveled is equal to the remaining distance (s = last
       + penultimate = (v+at)t + at^2/2+vt -> a = 2/3(s-2vt)/t^2).
