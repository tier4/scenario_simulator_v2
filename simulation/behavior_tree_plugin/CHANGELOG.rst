  - Enhanced BehaviorTree to consider altitude when detecting potential obstacles,
  allowing to ignore objects located at different altitudes.
  - Modified the detection sensor by introducing Ego plane determination to exclude objects below the Ego plane,
  preventing unnecessary slowing or stopping caused by incorrect detections.
